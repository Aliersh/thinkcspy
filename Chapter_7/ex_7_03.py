'''Write a function which is given an exam mark, and it returns a string â€” the grade for that mark â€” according to this scheme:
Mark     Grade
>= 90      A
[80-90)    B
[70-80)    C
[60-70)    D
< 60       F

The square and round brackets denote closed and open intervals. A closed interval includes the number, and 
open interval excludes it. So 79.99999 gets grade C , but 80 gets grade B.
Test your function by printing the mark and the grade for a number of different marks.'''

def getGrade(m):
    if m>=90:
        return "A"
    elif m>=80 and m<90:
        return "B"
    elif m>=70 and m<80:
        return "C"
    elif m>=60 and m<70:
        return "D"
    else:
        return "F"

grade=getGrade(100)
print(grade)
